# MicroserviceProject
In this project I'm going to make microservices with Spring technologies like Eureka and ApiGateway.
## Spring
When we are doing a Microservice there are important components:
### Entity
A class of type Entity indicates a class that, at an abstract level, is correlated with a table in the database. Each object instantiated by this class indicates a tuple of the table itself, containing the information of the latter.
### Repository
A repository is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects.
### Service
Indicates the business logic
### Controller
A controller is responsible to process the requests of API REST and with this make the responses
